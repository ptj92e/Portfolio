            <p class="text-secondary">My name is Phillip Jones and I live in Hendersonville, TN. I am currently in
                my second year as a music educator teaching band, choir, and general music at Shafer Middle School
                in Gallatin, TN. Through my love of music, I decided to become an educator to hopefully pass on the
                love of music I have to the future generations. Students I have taught have gone on to make regional
                honor bands, earn scholarships for summer music camps, and even earn scholarships to play music in
                college. I LOVE marching band and I am very proud of the hard work of my current and past students.
                Some of their accomplishments include making finals at Bands of America regional competitions, and
                even winning Tennessee Division II State Champions two years in a row.<br><br>
                My instrument of choice is Trombone, but I also play Euphonium and Tuba from time to time. I
                have played with different professional groups such as the Intersection Music Ensemble and the
                Nashville Opera. Of course, like a lot of musicians, I also consider guitar a hobby that I really
                enjoy. I love metal music and it is what drove me to want to teach myself how to play guitar. It is
                fulfilling for me to be able to play the music I enjoy even if I never play for an audience.<br><br>
                Unfortunately, teaching is very stressful and it has taken away all of the joy I find in music.
                Through talking with my wife, we decided that it would be a great time for me to rethink my career
                decisions and I think that web development would be a great opportunity for me to not only feel
                accomplished in the work I do, but to hopefully regain some of the love of music I have lost.</p>
