# Professional-Portfolio

For this new portfolio page, I decided to test my CSS skills and create a page on my own. 

On load, you will see a Welcome screen fade in on the page which uses the Animate.CSS framework to make things on the page look a lot nicer. In the top right hand side, you will also notice a nav bar with the buttons: Bio, Portfolio, and Contact. These buttons are not links to different pages, but rather they set the window position to that specific div. 

Another new technology I used for this page was the ScrollMagic.js library that allows for effects to be added when elements hit specific break points on the screen. When I scroll away from the welcome screen, the Bio div fades in and moves up slightly to make the experience on the website more appealing to the user. I applied this to all of the divs on the page so that when they are scrolled to or away from, they can fade in and out. 

I also added one more feature in the portfolio div and the contact div that if the mouse icon hovers over one of the cards containing an item of my portfolio or a contact section, the color of that card will change.
